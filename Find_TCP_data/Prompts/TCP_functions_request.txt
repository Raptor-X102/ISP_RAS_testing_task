Hi! I am analyzing TCP protocol implementation. Your task is to list only the names of functions specific to this protocol. Examples of such functions are parser functions and handler functions.
For each function found, return the following information:
- The file name where it was found
- The line number
- The function name
- Its type: parser, handler, validator, etc.
Please output your response as a JSON list of objects in this format

[
  {{
    "file": "tcp_parser.c",
    "line": 42,
    "function_name": "tcp_parse_header",
    "type": "parser"
  }}
]

Return ONLY the JSON object, without any other text before or after.
Do not add explanations, markdown, or anything else.

Code to analyze:
